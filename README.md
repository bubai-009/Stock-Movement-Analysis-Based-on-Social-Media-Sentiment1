# Stock-Movement-Analysis-Based-on-Social-Media-Sentiment1

# objective
Develop a machine learning model that predicts stock movements
by scraping data from social media platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or
Telegram. The model should extract insights from user-generated
content, such as stock discussions, predictions, or sentiment analysis,
and accurately forecast stock price trends.

# Install Libraries
In this project, I am analyzing stock market movement based on the
sentiment of social media posts using various Python libraries. To
begin, I have installed several essential libraries such as Telethon,
NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, yfinance,
TextBlob, VADER Sentiment, emoji, Urlextract, Gensim, and
pyLDAvis. These libraries are pivotal in collecting, processing, and
visualizing data from social media platforms like Twitter. Using
Telethon, I can scrape social media data, while NLTK, TextBlob,
and VADER Sentiment assist in sentiment analysis. Pandas is used
for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data
visualization, and WordCloud helps generate word clouds to
visually capture frequent terms. Additionally, yfinance allows for
stock data retrieval, and Gensim and pyLDAvis support topic
modeling, which is useful for uncovering trends in social media posts
related to stock movements. This comprehensive setup enables the
analysis of how sentiment around specific stocks correlates with their
market performance.
